# pitch

Pitch change in cents. Apparently equivalent to tune.

Range of tune in the SFZ1 spec is Â±1 semitone, from -100 to 100, though at least
in ARIA, it seems a broader range is supported, at least -2400 to 2400 cents.
Only negative values must be prefixed with sign.

##### Examples

```
pitch=33
pitch=-30
pitch=94
```
