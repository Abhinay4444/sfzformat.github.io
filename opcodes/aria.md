title: ARIA Extensions Opcodes (SFZ 3 hopefuls)
---
ARIA also adds some [extended MIDI CCs](/extensions/aria/midi_cc) in addition
to those already added by [SFZ 2](/opcodes/sfz2),
and [XML instrument banks](/extensions/aria/xml_instrument_bank) as a way of
organizing multiple SFZ instruments and configuring graphical user interfaces.
