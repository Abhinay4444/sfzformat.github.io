title: (lfo type)_delay
---
The time before the LFO starts oscillating, in seconds.

##### Examples

```
pitchlfo_delay=1
amplfo_delay=0.4
```

This is very useful, as many instruments and vocals don't trigger vibrato
immediately when a note starts, but slightly later.

| Type  | Default | Range         |
| ---   | ---     | ---           |
| float | 0       | -100 to 100 s |
