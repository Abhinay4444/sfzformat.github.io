The filter cutoff resonance value, in decibels.

##### Example

```
resonance=4
resonance_oncc100=3
```

Raising this can easily result in a very large boost to frequencies around
the cutoff, which can result in extremely loud output!

| Type    | Default | Range      |
| ---     | ---     | ---        |
| integer | 0       | 0 to 40 dB |
