# delay

Region delay time, in seconds. If a delay value is specified, the region
playback will be postponed for the specified time. If the region receives a
note-off message before delay time, the region won't play.

Sample playback and all envelope generators' delay stage will start counting
after region delay time - this is the difference between this and ampeg_delay.

Examples:

```
delay=1
delay=0.2
```

Range: 0-100 seconds.
Example uses: delaying some regions in a strum or a flam;
delaying regions to emulate more distant microphone positions.
