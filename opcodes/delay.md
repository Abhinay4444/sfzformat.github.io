title: delay
---
Region `delay` time, in seconds. If a `delay` value is specified, the region
playback will be postponed for the specified time. If the region receives a
note-off message before `delay` time, the region won't play.

Sample playback and all envelope generators' delay stage will start counting
after region delay time - this is the difference between this and [ampeg_delay]((eg_type)_delay).

##### Examples

```
delay=1

delay=0.2
```

Example uses: delaying some regions in a strum or a flam;
delaying regions to emulate more distant microphone positions.

`delay_onccN` uses same type, range and default values.
