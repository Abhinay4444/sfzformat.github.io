Range of `tune` in the SFZ1 spec is Â±1 semitone, from -100 to 100, though at least
in ARIA, it seems a broader range is supported, at least -2400 to 2400 cents.

To modulate tuning, see [pitch](pitch).

## Examples

```
tune=33
tune=-30
tune=94
```

Uses include correcting the intonation of naturally off-pitch samples, and
detuning unison voices.
