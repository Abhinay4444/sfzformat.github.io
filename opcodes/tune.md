# tune

The fine tuning for the sample, in cents. Range in the SFZ1 spec is Â±1 semitone,
from -100 to 100, though at least in ARIA, it seems a broader range is supported,
at least -2400 to 2400 cents.

##### Examples

```
tune=33

tune=-30

tune=94
```

Uses include correcting the intonation of naturally off-pitch samples, and
detuning unison voices.

| Type    | Default | Range       |
| ---     | ---     | ---         |
| integer | 0       | -100 to 100 |
