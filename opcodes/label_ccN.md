title: label_ccN

Under the <[control](/headers/control)> header,
used to create a label for the MIDI CC.
Some DAWs will display those labels as paramter names, and Sforzando will also
use them in the Control tab if no GUI is defined.

Examples:

```
label_cc30=Bass vol
label_cc31=Bass pan
label_cc32=Tune
label_cc33=Mute
```
