title: lfoN_freq_smoothccX
---
Sets the smoothness with which LFO number N is modulated by MIDI CC X.
Adds "inertia" to modulation, so fast movements of the controller will have
a delayed, smoothed effect.

##### Examples

```
lfo01_freq_oncc70=5
lfo01_freq_smoothcc70=100

lfo01_freq_oncc71=10
lfo01_freq_smoothcc71=1000
```
