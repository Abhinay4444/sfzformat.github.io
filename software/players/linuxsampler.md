The LinuxSampler project was founded in 2002 with the goal to produce a free,
streaming capable open source pure software audio sampler with high stability,
efficiency and very low latency, providing professional grade features,
comparable to both hardware and commercial Windows/Mac software samplers and to
introduce new features not yet available by any other sampler in the world.
