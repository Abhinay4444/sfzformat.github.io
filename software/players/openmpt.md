[OpenMPT] is a popular [tracker] software for Windows.
OpenMPT (short hand for Open ModPlug Tracker) is completely free and allows you
to create and play back some great music on your computer. Based on the original
ModPlug Tracker written by Olivier Lapicque, OpenMPT is free software,
can import a wide variety of module formats and offers an intuitive,
native GUI as well as advanced features such as VST plugins and `ASIO` output.
In addition to its own song format, OpenMPT can natively edit Impulse Tracker,
FastTracker, Scream Tracker and ProTracker module files. Read more about it
on the [features] page!

OpenMPT can also import and export SFZ files,
