# SFZ creation tools

Although SFZ files can be created with any text editor, and some users have also
created SFZ with spreadsheets, there are some dedicated tools which can make
mapping large amounts of samples easier. As SFZ instruments can quickly grow to
thousands of samples, efficiency in creating the mappings becomes important.
One way of creating SFZ files is to use one of these tools to create the initial
maps with keys, dynamic layers, round robins etc. defined,
then add controls etc. using a text editor.

Some available tools are:
