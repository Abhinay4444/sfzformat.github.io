##### Available for OEM use

- [ARIA Engine](http://ariaengine.com/)

##### No longer available

- Cakewalk sfz
- Alchemy (Camel Audio was acquired by Apple, no longer supporting SFZ.)

Sforzando currently offers the most complete SFZ standard support, including
[ARIA extensions](/opcodes/aria), but SFZ files which only use the
[SFZ 1](/opcodes/sfz1) or [SFZ 2](/opcodes/sfz2) standard will
work with multiple SFZ players.
