There are several SFZ players, which are used to play samples as defined in SFZ
files.

Sforzando currently offers the most complete SFZ standard support, including
[ARIA extensions](/extensions/aria/), but SFZ files which only use the
[SFZ 1](/misc/sfz1) or [SFZ 2](/misc/sfz2) standard will
work with multiple SFZ players.
