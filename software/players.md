title: SFZ Players
---
There are several SFZ players, which are used to play samples as defined in SFZ
files.

Sforzando currently offers the most complete SFZ standard support, including
[ARIA extensions](/opcodes/aria), but SFZ files which only use the
[SFZ 1](/opcodes/sfz1) or [SFZ 2](/opcodes/sfz2) standard will
work with multiple SFZ players.
