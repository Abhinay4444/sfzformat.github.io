New applications were added to the players list recently:
- [HISE]
- [sfizz]
- [liquidsfz]

and a new tutorial from [Sonoj 2019 Convention] on [how to recording samples
using Ardour and LinuxSampler] by [Christoph Kuhr] to our
[Video tutorials] section.

Thanks to [Stefan Westerfeld] for our first GitHub pull request! And to
[Nils Hilbricht] for the video tutorial contribuition.

Last but not least, for those like me who prefer [IRC] we have now also an
[IRC channel] on [freenode] server.
