title: "SFZ v2 Opcodes"
sfz_version: "SFZ v2"

The SFZ v2 standard has never been clearly set down anywhere. For the purpose of this website, anything included in the SFZ v2 regression tests or mentioned in the Cakewalk book is considered SFZ v2, and anything not there is considered an extension. If something works in a Cakewalk product, such as Rapture, but is not mentioned in the book, that's considered a Cakewalk extension.

The book is not recent, and was not intended to be a standards document, but rather a manual for users of Cakewalk products. So, if you are developing a new SFZ player, do not feel obligated to support all opcodes in this list - instead, use your judgment.
