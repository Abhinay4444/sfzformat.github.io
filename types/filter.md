# Filter type

Filter opcodes are part of the [Performance parameters](/categories/performance_parameters)
category of opcodes:

Filter opcodes influence the timbre of the layer played. Two filters can be used
at the same time. Further frequency shaping can be added via EQ opcodes.

Cutoff and resonance can be modulated by the [LFO](/categories/lfo) and
[Envelope Generators](/categories/envelope_generators)
