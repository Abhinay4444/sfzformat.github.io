# Dimension Pro - sfz v2 test suite 1

November 24, 05 12:52 AM

Hello DPers,

Dimension Pro features the latest sfz engine, with the latest sfz v2 opcode set.
There's no Ã³fficial documentation for it, as the spec isn't totally finished.
However, I thought some of you might want to peek at what's new, updated and changed.
I've put together the first test suite for v2 in a way it's user readable.
Every sfz file is commented inside, so I'm sure you'll find your way thru.

Comments welcome. Enjoy!
